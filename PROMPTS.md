## 1. Initial Vision & Architecture

### Rewriting the Tool
```
Look at this notebook, I believe it would fail as it is as the libraries it relies on
are not supporting those things anymore (in particular obtaining the scores for each
episode of each season). Make a plan based on what you know and see online to rewrite
this as a tool that takes a tv series and returns the make_series_plot
```

### Making it a Web Application
```
If i would like this to be a tool that people could use on a very simple webpage say
hosted in github.io pages for instance how would i do that? would it be possible?
```

## 2. User Experience

### Mobile Responsiveness
```
When looking from a laptop this tool works great but it doesn't from mobile.
make a plan to fix this problem
```

## 3. Performance & Scalability

### Implementing Caching Strategy
```
Can you add to this project a way to cache the scraped data and regenerate it only
once a month? this way we limit the calls made for the same series
```

Built collaboratively with Claude in under 30 minutes of initial development, with iterative improvements over subsequent sessions.
